                    <p>A mocha is ideal for all the chocolate lovers out there<br>as it combines chocolate with

                        with chocolate sprinkles on top.</p>

                    <p>A cappuccino is very similar to a latte. The only difference<br>between them is that it contains
                        more foam than steamed<br>milk and often has a sprinkle of chocolate or cinnamon on<br>top for
                        something a little extra special. </p>
